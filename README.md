# Python Compiler in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Overview
This project is a fully functional Python compiler built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The IDE (Integrated Development Environment) provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface to write, run, and manage Python code directly in the browser.

## Features
- **Run Python Code**: Execute Python scripts seamlessly within the IDE.
- **Save Code**: Save your Python scripts to your local machine.
- **Copy Code**: Easily copy your code to the clipboard for reuse.
- **Delete Code**: Clear the editor to start fresh.
- **Light/Dark Theme**: Toggle between light and dark themes for a personalized coding experience.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Enhanced readability with syntax highlighting for Python code.
- **Code Hints**: Receive suggestions and hints while coding to improve efficiency and accuracy.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**:
  - HTML for structure
  - CSS for styling (including light and dark mode support)
  - JavaScript for interactivity and compiler functionality
- **Backend**: None (the project is entirely client-side and runs in the browser).

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Use the editor to:
